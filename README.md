# Learning and planning from self regulating signals



An proof-of-concept of an active inference agent where the preference/desire distribution emerges in a self-supervised manner from the interaction between the agent and the environment.

Currently the preference distribution only takes into account one of the seven different signals the agent receives. The frequency of this signal gives rise to the parameters that specify the distribution.
